```
Crimson flames tied through my ears, rolling high and mighty traps. Pounced with fire on flaming roads, using ideas as my maps, "We'll meet on edges soon" said I, Proud 'neath heated brow"
```

That's what I'm thiking about.

## Education 

#### B.A, AnQing Normal University

> September 2015 —— June 2019

I'm a folk who used to want to be a designer or a reporter, things had changed when I abstracted my first design for an campus App, no one can make it come true in my friendships, so I taught myself how to write programs and could not stop it...

I taught myself most of the time in college, free from it when I was a junior(_broke the law of our school in some way..._), and finally got the diploma by luck. I'm not a good student for school, but might the better dude for human history.
